OpenRTM on Docker (docker-openrtm)
==================================

# What is **OpenRTM on Docker**?
**OpenRTM on Docker** is docker images for [OpenRTM-aist](http://www.openrtm.org/openrtm/).

# Motivation
## Use OpenRTM-aist easier!
When developing RT-Components(RTC), the verication must be carried out by combining versions.
Various OSs and versions of RT-Middleware...
Especially, it is serious for high diversity and backwards compatibility.
It causes to increase costs for building the environment.
Solve these issues by providing the development environment of RT-Middleware using Docker.
We hope to reduce the cost of environmental construction for RTC developers.
