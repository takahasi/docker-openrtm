Docker for OpenRTM (docker-openrtm)
===================================

# What is **Docker for OpenRTM**?
**Docker for OpenRTM** is docker images for [OpenRTM-aist](http://www.openrtm.org/openrtm/).

# Motivation
## Use OpenRTM-aist easier!
When developing RT-Components(RTC) with high diversity and backwards compatibility,
the verication must be carried out by combining versions of various OSs and versions of RT-Middleware.
It causes to increase costs for building the environment.
By providing the development environment of RT-Middleware using Docker,
we hope to reduce the cost of environmental construction for RTC developers.
